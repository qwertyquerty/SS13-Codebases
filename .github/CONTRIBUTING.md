## Pull Request Process

There is no strict process when it comes to merging pull requests. Pull requests will sometimes take a while before they are looked at by a maintainer; the bigger the change, the more time it will take before they are accepted.

Please feel free to:
 * add your own [codebase(s)](https://github.com/search?q=language%3ADM&type=Repositories);
 * add missing [codebases](https://github.com/search?q=language%3ADM&type=Repositories);
 * fix mistakes through a [Pull Requests (PR is short)](https://github.com/CthulhuOnIce/SS13-Codebases/pulls).

## Banned content

Do not add any of the following in a Pull Request or risk getting the PR closed:

* Code which violates GitHub's [terms of service](https://github.com/site/terms).
